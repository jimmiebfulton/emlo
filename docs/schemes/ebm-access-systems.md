## Overview

This document spells out an apparent scheme, planned and executed over multiple
years, to fabricate a need for unnecessary contract work under fraudulent
pretenses for the purposes of generating a profit through [kickbacks/bribery] (/docs/concepts/kickbacks).

We seek to demonstrate the following:

- Planning over multiple years:
  - By removing impediments to the scheme, including:
    - Driving out dissenting board members
      - Through defamatory means
      - Through bullying and gaslighting
    - Removing vendors that present obstacles for execution
  - Installing facilitators of the scheme, including:
    - Getting sympathetic/compliant board members elected
      - Through violations of election rules
      - Persistence
    - Bringing on vendors willing to participate in:
      - Execution of the scheme
      - Cover up/conceal the scheme
- With [cooperation of](/docs/concepts/conspiracy):
  - Multiple board members across elections
  - Multiple vendors across contracts
- Executed fraudulently
- With intent to [generate recurring profit through fraudulent means](/docs/concepts/racketeering)
- With a [guilty mind/consciousness of guilt](/docs/concepts/mens-rea)
- with attempts to [conceal the acts and avoid discovery](/docs/concepts/overt-acts)
