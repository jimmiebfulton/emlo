## Overview

This document spells out an apparent scheme, planned and executed over multiple
years, to fabricate a need for unnecessary contract work under fraudulent
pretenses for the purposes of generating a profit through [kickbacks/bribery](/docs/concepts/kickbacks).

We seek to demonstrate the following:

- Planning over multiple years:
  - By removing impediments to the scheme, including:
    - Driving out dissenting board members
      - Through defamatory means
      - Through bullying and gaslighting
    - Removing vendors that present obstacles for execution
  - Installing facilitators of the scheme, including:
    - Getting sympathetic/compliant board members elected
      - Through violations of election rules
      - Persistence
    - Bringing on vendors willing to participate in:
      - Execution of the scheme
      - Cover up/conceal the scheme
- With [cooperation of](/docs/concepts/conspiracy):
  - Multiple board members across elections
  - Multiple vendors across contracts
- With intent to [generate recurring profit through fraudulent means](/docs/concepts/racketeering)
- With a [guilty mind/consciousness of guilt](/docs/concepts/mens-rea)
- With attempts to [conceal the acts and avoid discovery](/docs/concepts/overt-acts)

## Requirements and Costs

From what I can glean, we are required to have annual and 5-year Safety
Equipment inspections to ensure we are compliant with OSHA standards.

Based on information and belief, inspections should be approximately as follows:

- Annual: $1000
- 5 Year: $5000

## Timeline

### March 31, 2021

This invoice, [2021-03-31 - Lynn Safety](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/0jak7pfw53qbowv93cmz1/2021-03-31-First-Service-Scaffold-Inspection-Testing-Contract.pdf?rlkey=0qann7rnv3vsak7navd0eajlm&e=1&dl=0), while [First Service Residential](/docs/vendors/first-service)
was our property manager, shows a bill for $13,000.

#### Observations

- Based on other timeline facts, this appears to be a contract for an annual
  inspection, as opposed to a 5-year inspection, which should cost more
- First Service Residential has, at a previous association, provided me with:
  - Falsified Bank Records
  - Financial Records with modified and removed entries
  - Has admitted in writing to significantly overpaying vendor by hundreds of
    thousands of dollars, and never recovering those overpaid amounts.
- The board allowed this vendor to grossly overcharge for their services.

### June 01, 2022

This proposal, [2022-06-01 Lynn Safety](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/nwwtpbyakoy2x4om4l14c/2022-06-01-Lynn-Safety-Quote-Code-Compliance-Failure-Remediation-Proposal.pdf?rlkey=p26gr8f4v3oduy114zs2gw15t&dl=0), initiated by
[Bohan](/docs/vendors/bohan) property management, says that
we have failed Code Compliance inspections, and Lynn Safety is proposing
$81,000 to remedy this.

<figcaption>Lynn Safety Estimate</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Observations

- Failing an OSHA Code Compliance inspection is a serious issue
- Any violations would be reported to OSHA, which would trigger timelines for
  remedy, measured in months.
- A board would almost certainly raise this issue with General Counsel, who
  would be involved in ensuring the board is protected.
- While Shirley Lam was on the board, she questioned the veracity of this
  proposal, and she expressed that the reactions of fellow board members was
  "waffling"
- To my knowledge, this association has not received notices for failing to
  remedy OSHA Code Compliance violations, neither has the board stated as such.
- Lynn Safety stood to benefit significantly if they were awarded a contract
  for which they identified failures.

### Questions

- Which testing date and invoice were these test failures identified under?
- Do you have the test reports that show there were failures? I certainly hope
  you can produce them.
- Did the board take action on this proposal?
  - If not, why not?
  - Did the board feel that remedying a Code Compliance violation was optional?
  - Was the reason the board members not take action because they had knowledge
    that this failure claim was made fraudulently?
  - Have there been any consequence for not following though with this
    remedy?
- Considering the size of the proposal:
  - Did the board get a second opinion?
  - Undergo competitive bidding?
- Why wasn't the association notified of such a large expense?
- Why wasn't there are significant discussion and planning on how to resolve
  the compliance issue, and how the association was going to fund it?
- Where was the money going to come from to pay for this? The slush fund
  created by over-budgeting Office Supplies and Miscellaneous?

## August 2022

This notification, [2022-09-23 - Ryan O'Connor - 5 Year Inspection Notification](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/oyy509xydq8idzdish9nb/2022-10-07-Lynn-Safety-Annual-Inspection-Quote.pdf?rlkey=xiv7e7em5widlbsngnaks3qw7&dl=0),
indicates that we would be having a 5-Year Inspection, just a short 4 months
after being notified that we had already failed inspections. Strange.

This quote, [2022-10-07 Lynn Safety](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/oyy509xydq8idzdish9nb/2022-10-07-Lynn-Safety-Annual-Inspection-Quote.pdf?rlkey=xiv7e7em5widlbsngnaks3qw7&dl=0), shows 80 tests for $825.00. Peculiar.

This test notification, [2022-10-12 - Lynn Safety - Notification](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/0ox82j2vpawdcaa8n74ax/2022-10-12-Lynn-Safety-Inspection-Passed-Notification.pdf?rlkey=thgcawv0ro6yzu92wb5oeg5o3&dl=0), says that we
passed this inspection. Most curious.

These test reports, [2022-10-24 - Lynn Safety - Test Report 1](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/82inr52dlof4yy4rinpfs/2022-10-24-Lynn-Safety-Test-Report-1.pdf?rlkey=ggm3u7onci9y4hcix72wwknwa&dl=0)
and [2022-12-01 - Lynn Safety - Test Report 2](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/9k4scj2707xohr3wyzlm9/2022-12-01-Lynn-Safety-Test-Report-2.pdf?rlkey=wyfs6kg17m6oita8153kd691u&dl=0), say the same
thing.

During this inspection, Lynn Safety required that units 603 and 612
undertake expensive modifications to planters and infrastructure that were
obstacles for testing the Safety Equipment. These obstructions have been there
for many years, exceeding the time period for the previous 5-Year Inspection.

### Inferences

- The proposal from June 2022, with it's statement that we had failed
  inspections, was made fraudulently.
- The fact that the board insisted on using Lynn Safety, after having knowledge
  of this previous report, indicates that they knew this was a fraudulent
  proposal, but wanted Lynn Safety to get the work, anyway.
- It is reasonable to infer that our General Counsel, Alex Noland, if he was
  involved with failed inspection reports, proposals, and contract reviews,
  would also have a belief that the June 2022 proposal was fraudulent.
- Lynn Safety and/or other inspectors failed to adequately inspect units 603
  and 612 in past inspections, and/or they were angered that they did not
  get the $81,000 contract, and incurred more work than they have in the past.
  I believe both to be true.
  - Both myself, and OSHA, would like to know which one.
- It is my current stance that BanCal and our on-site Property Manager Ryan
  O'Connor to be honest actors. Under their management, it is noteworthy that
  Lynn Safety bills were dramatically lower than under First Service
  Residential. It is also noteworthy that Ryan O'Connor called Lynn Safety
  a scam, while he was working with them, indicating he also believed the above
  assertions.

### Questions

- You've got some serious explaining to do...

## August 2024

This contract, [2024-08-05 - Lynn Safety - Proposal](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/25y192796bu0wzr87uqxg/2024-08-05-Anchors-Contract-KJW-Executed.pdf?rlkey=wzvttdgx9798lmmjs4b50t6rf&dl=0), signed by Karen Wendell,
is for approximately $20,000, once again, for assertions that we have failed
Code Compliance inspections. It is notable that $20,000 for repair work is not
much more than previous inspections themselves, which should cost a lot less
than manual labor the repair work. It is also significantly less than the
previous $81,000 proposal.

Not log ago, Lynn Safety came by my unit to take measurements of the equipment
on my terrace. I asked one of the representative what this was for, and he
said it was for "OSHA Requirements".

I took this photo of the equipment on my terrace, [Inspection Sticker](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/7q8an13ep8wo8mdrn0kjo/2025-01-19-Jimmie-Fulton-Inspection-Sticker.HEIC?rlkey=01lkmgallxsb5yo8dcftxwfga&dl=0), with a
date of 2024. I don't believe inspections stickers are handed out for failed
inspections. The gentleman measuring my equipment certainly had the knowledge
that the equipment he was measuring had a passing sticker on it.

### Questions

- Has an inspection failure been reported to OSHA? This can easily be verified.
  Go ahead and lie to me. I'll be checking your answers, or showing appropriate
  parties that you couldn't.
- What conditions or changes in code have changed since the last time we passed
  an inspection, and the time where Lynn Safety fraudulently asserted that we
  had failed inspections?
- Why is it that the proposed repair work is far less expensive than from the
  proposal in June 2022? What conditions changed? Did the equipment spontaneously
  get repaired, or is it that NOTHING has changed?
- Why should we believe that this proposal is not also fraudulent, which I
  believe it is?
- Why should you be allowed to stay on the board if you are so negligent that
  you appear to be engage in fraud, or more likely, you're just engaged in
  fraud?

## Conclusions

Bruce, I'm certain you understand the gravity of this situation, and the
importance of you providing a cohesive explanation that fully justifies the
actions of the board.

Because this is what is looks like to me:

In context with multiple other schemes that I will be producing in just as much
damning detail, it appears that this board has long-engaged in kickback/bribery
schemes with a number of vendors. This board chooses vendors that are willing
to "play ball". Under First Service, a property management company know to me
to have engaged in fraud at at least one other association, Lynn Safety, with
involvement from the board, allowed Lynn Safety to overcharge for services, and
make false code compliance failure reports for the purpose of deceiving honest
board members into voting for these corrupt schemes.

Your refusal to fully provide all association records, and unwillingness to
undergo an audit, even one provided for free, indicates a conciousness of guilt.

Katy, who has been providing the subset of requestion documents, provided a
response to me that looked very much like an attorney wrote it, and it is not
unreasonable to believe that Alex Noland would have had a hand in crafting it.
That response specifically calls out that "Test Reports" are not called out in
Davis-Stirling. However, my understanding is that Davis-Stirling is a black
list, not a white list, and that inspection reports are no more or less
privileged than general ledgers. It is my belief that failure to provide
inspection reports are that there is implicit knowledge that the only reports
that can be provided are Passing Reports, and that there are not Failure Reports.

Acceptance of money or services in exchange for awarding contracts is called
bribery, and kickbacks. This is not just a violation of civil code. This is
a violation of criminal code, for which people can and do go to prison.

This information puts Alex Noland in a very precarious position. I, and other,
have sent communications expressing concerns of fraud that Mr. Noland is privy
to. And now, I'm demonstrating detailed evidence that indicates that there is
indeed fraud. It is reasonable to conclude that Alex Noland should have at
least a suspicion of fraud being perpetrated by this board and it's vendors.
It is then reasonable to conclude that if Alex Noland were to continue providing
his services under these conditions, he may be party to a crime. The Crime-Fraud
provision can pierce Attorney-Client privilege.

A clear, cohesive response from you is critical, because if you can't explain
this, I will feel justified in notifying the Bar Association of my concerns.
And of course, law enforcement, and the media.

For the honest board members: If there are three of you, you have the power to
out-vote the other two, call meetings, remove officers from positions, fire
attorneys, and initiate an audit. It is ESSENTIAL to distance yourselves from
these activities, assume you are being lied to by our attorney, property
management, Bruce, and Karen. These are very serious allegations, and it would
be folly to make them carelessly. The fact that I make them so brazenly, with
this much detail, should be a strong indicator that it is imperative that you
take proactive steps to protect yourselves. It doesn't get better from here.

## Where do we go from here?

If this board attempts to sue, we counter sue for fraud, subpoena records, and
force an audit, and have it all presented in a legal setting where you face
a potential criminal referral. Or, we share this information with the association,
initiate a recall, and take over the board, gain access to documents, and force
an audit. Or, we take our evidence to the media, which will most certainly make
for a VERY compelling story, and potentially gets the attention of law
enforcement. Or we sue outright for fraud, in which case we subpoena for records
and force an audit.

There are no circumstances where you remain on this board. If you don't leave
willingly, taking the off-ramp, we'll pull every lever necessary until you do.

Be smart: Take the off-ramp.
