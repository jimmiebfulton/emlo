# Overview

Embarcadero Lofts is a 6 story condominium located at 300 Beale ST, San
Francisco CA, 94105. The building was constructed in 1937 and renovated in 1996.
There are 59 residential units, and 5 commercial units.

commercial owners. Residential owners are only able to vote for the 3 residential
owner positions, and commercial owners are only able to vote for commercial unit
positions.

## Synopsis

Upon information and belief, the Embarcadero Lofts Board, Property Management,
and multiple vendors have been engaging in Kickbacks/Bribes, Embezzlement,
and Steering Contracts. It is our belief that the association's General Counsel
is at least aware of the conduct at best, and facilitates, makes connections
between board members and vendors, and intimidates homeowners viewed as threats
to their schemes.

This conduct appears to have been occurring for at least 20 or more years, with
an intent to generate continuous returns, and constitutes Racketeering.

These frauds have occurred across multiple property management companies and
vendors, demonstrating a persistent ability to continuously find new
participants. There are several key homeowners that have maintained influence
and/or positions over the board to ensure they maintain exclusive control of the
finances and vendor selections, and manage to exert their influence on or off of
the board.
