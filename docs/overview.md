# Overview

Embarcadero Lofts is a 6 story condominium located at 300 Beale ST, San
Francisco CA, 94105. The building was constructed in 1937 and renovated in 1996.
There are 59 residential units, and 5 commercial units.

The Embarcadero Lofts Owner's Board is composed of 3 residential owners and 2
commercial owners. Residential owners are only able to vote for the 3 residential
owner positions, and commercial owners are only able to vote for commercial unit
positions.

## Synopsis

Upon information and belief, the Embarcadero Lofts Board, Property Management,
and multiple vendors have been engaging in Kickbacks/Bribes, Embezzlement,
and Steering Contracts. It is our belief that the association's General Counsel
is at least aware of the conduct at best, and facilitates, makes connections
between board members and vendors, and intimidates homeowners viewed as threats
to their schemes.

This conduct appears to have been occurring for at least 20 or more years, with
an intent to generate continuous returns, and constitutes Racketeering.

These frauds span across multiple board members, property management companies,
and vendors, demonstrating a persistent ability to continuously find new
participants. There are several key homeowners that have maintained influence
and/or positions over the board to ensure they maintain exclusive control of the
finances and vendor selections, and they manage to exert their influence on or
off of the board.

## Key Indicators and Red Flags

The indicators for fraud are egregious, extensive, and obvious to anyone paying
attention or looking in to the alleged conduct.

- Slush Fund Creation Tactics
  - Grossly over and under budgeting financial categories
    - Creating excess, unnecessary funds in some categories, year after year
    - And hiding the true intended recipients in grossly under-funded categories
  - Budgeted categories that never get used for the budgeted purpose, year
    after year
  - Significant deviations of budgeted to actuals ratios, year after year
  - Secretly commingling reserves and operating funds
  - Secretly using funds out of reserves
  - Secretly underfunding reserves
  - Executing a scheme to "not fund the reserves for the pandemic", but
    redirecting an additional $75,000 of unbudgeted funds to the operating account
  - Paying for a 14 month contract, and cancelling after 12 months in an apparent
    strategy to have an additional 2 months of unbudgeted funds
  - Proposing a 12 month contract for a 14 month contract amount in an apparent
    strategy to have an additional 2 months of unbudgeted funds
- Refusal to provide association records
  - Partial compliance of association records requests
  - Specifically withholding invoices from vendors awarded the most money
  - Using excuses like:
    - "Sometimes, we don't get invoices... the vendors call us up and we pay them"
    - "We gave you everything in our possession"
      - Ignoring document retention requirements
      - Ignoring that board members must review invoices
- Communications:
  - Violations of the Open Meetings Act
    - Discussions in executive meetings that should be discussed in open meetings
    - Evident that corrupt board members, property management, and vendors have
      pre-planned and pre-discussed schemes that did not include honest board
      members
  - Open Board Meetings are pre-rehearsed, and a charade
    - Very limited amount of time for questions and discussion
    - Important items raised only in board meetings, which few members attend
    - Meeting Minutes do not reflect actual discussions or include material facts
    - Costs, variances, or any other financial numbers are ever discussed
  - Selectively excluding homeowners from membership communications
- Evidence of long-term planning of major expenditures and projects
  - That are never budgeted
  - Never disclosed with the membership
  - Never included in disclosures
- Expense Shopping
  - Attempting to engage the same vendor for multiple unrelated projects in an
    attempt to see which project "sticks"
- Repeated, shameless engagement in gross conflicts of interests
  - Such as the board president's personal contractor getting multiple contract
    work
    - By property management that was recommended by the same contractor
  - That is never disclosed to the membership
- Refusal to get competitive bids
  - Even when presented with significantly less expensive options
  - And being aware that the more expensive vendor has been unethical
  - Unless the board is forced to take on a project they didn't want to pursue
- Re-engaging a property management company that was previously fired for
  "financial mismanagement"
- Smearing the reputations of honest board members in order to ensure their
  schemes get support
- Bullying of board members to drive away honest board members
