# Overt Act

According to [Cornell Law School](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/overt_act):

> Generally, an overt act refers to a specific and observable action or conduct
> that is taken by an individual, typically in furtherance of a particular
> purpose or intent . While the term "overt act" has different legal meanings
> depending on the context in which it is used, it is usually used in connection
> with **criminal law** with the implication generally being that an individual who
> conducts an overt act shows an **intention to commit a crime**.

In other words, an overt act means that an individual took an action that shows
they had specific intent to commit a crime, as opposed to negligence. A strong
indicator of an overt act is that the act was completely unnecessarily and
required additional work, and that the act is connected to criminal conduct.

As an example, if a property manager is required to produce financial records,
but took additional unnecessary steps to withhold specific documents, this can
indicate that the property manager committed an overt act to hide documents, in
definance of civil laws, to prevent discovery of a crime. This also indicates
a "guilty mind" ([Mens Rea](/docs/concepts/mens-rea)).
